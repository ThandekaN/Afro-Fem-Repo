    <h1 class="underline">Introduction to HTML</h1> 
    <p> 
      HTML (<span class="bold underline">H</span>yper <span class="bold underline">T</span>ext <span class="bold underline">M</span>arkup <span class=" bold underline">L</span>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

    <h2 class="underline">So what is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way.
      For example, if we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:

    alt="Anatomy of an HTML element"
    width="500"
    />
    <p>The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect</li>
      <li><strong>Closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends.</li>
      <li>Other</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and content of a webpage, it says what content should be on a webpage.  An HTML document is made up of a series of elements. Some elements we covered in this lesson are...
      <ul>
        <li>Heading tag(s)</li>
        <li>paragraph</li>
        <li>List tags</li>
        <li>Image</li>
        <li>hyper references (link)</li>
      </ul>
